defmodule Charon.SessionStore.Behaviour do
  @moduledoc """
  Behaviour definition of a persistent session store.
  Clients should not use the implementation directly, but should use `Charon.SessionStore`.

  ## Implementation guidelines

  Implementations are expected to store sessions by ID, user ID and session type.
  For the optional callbacks `get_all/3` and `delete_all/3`, sessions should be retrievable
  by user ID and session type only.

  Implementations should return the session exactly as it went in
  (they don't have to take care of struct version upgrades).

  Implementations should handle cleanup of expired entries,
  but may define additional functions and instructions to take care of such things
  (like a `cleanup/0` that should run periodically).

  Implementations should implement optimistic locking with respect to the `:lock_version` field
  of the session struct. On an update, the lock version of the updated session should match
  the lock version of the existing session. If that is the case, the implementation should increase
  `:lock_version` and proceed with the update. If not, the implementation should abort the update
  and return `{:error, :conflict}`.
